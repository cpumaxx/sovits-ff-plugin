# sovits-ff-plugin
# Firefox Plugin for using GPT-SoVITS as a screen reader

You can add this plugin from the interface you get putting about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox in your address bar and pointing it at the manifest file.

Change the plugin preferences to something like https://tts.yourdomain.com/api_v2 or whatever your actual domain is and make sure you have your sovits api running on that url.

You can set up SoVITS and get the required files from https://huggingface.co/cpumaxx/SoVITS-anime-mini-tts
